#Bootcamp 2020 Materials
Alex Pizzuto, _University of Wisconsin-Madison_

The materials in this repository are for two talks given at the IceCube Neutrino Observatory's 2020 Bootcamp. The first, `intro_python` is for a quick introduction to python, including some packages used heavily in the scientific python community and with a brief introduction to profiling code.

The second talk, `bayesian_frequentist` is for a quick overview of statistics, including the distinction between Bayesian and Frequentist methods, and includes some practical examples on where these techniques/interpretations agree and differ.

The code was written in `python3`. I recommend using a virtual environment to run the code, and then all of the required packages could be installed using 

``` 
python3 -m venv bootcamp_venv
source bootcamp_venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt```
